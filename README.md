## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

1. **Initialize the Project:**
   - Create the directory structure as outlined above.
   - Place your existing Python class files (`pattern_manager_class.py`, `XABCD_classes.py`, etc.) into the respective folders.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project root and run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Populate the `.env` file with your API keys.

4. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - Access the app via `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

5. **Develop and Iterate:**
   - Enhance `app.py` to include more features, improve visualizations, and refine user interactions as needed.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Final Notes**

- **Modularity:**  
  The proposed structure ensures that your code is modular, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

- **Scalability:**  
  As your project grows, you can further organize modules, add more utility functions, and incorporate additional features without cluttering the main application script.

- **Version Control:**  
  Use Git for version control. Ensure sensitive files like `.env` are excluded using a `.gitignore` file.

- **Deployment:**  
  Once development is complete, consider deploying your Streamlit app using [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or other cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud for broader accessibility.
